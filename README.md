# Astro Finder Chart

Ported to C# and extended by Serge Meunier
https://github.com/sjmeunier/astro-finder-chart

This is a port of the fchart Python application, written by Austin Riba, and originally based on Michiel Brentjens' fchart 

The application is a Windows GUI application. All parameters for generating a chart can be easily set within the GUI. 
It is also possible to search for all stars and deep sky objects within the internal data to find objects to centre on. 
The charts can be saved to a PNG file. The application supports high resolutions (tested up to 12000x12000 pixels) in order to 
generate images which will look good when printed.
